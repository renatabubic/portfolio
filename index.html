            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    
            <p>
              <strong>Hello! I'm Renata,</strong> a full-stack software engineer based in NYC with a background in marketing and sales.</p>
    
              <p> My background is quite eclectic. In university, I completed an undergraduate degree in political science, and a master's degree in marketing. Since then, I've worked in
                in both a start up and a big corporate environments, acquiring many hard and soft skills a long the way. Most recently, I made a huge decision to leave my cushy corporate
                job and follow my interest in web-development. After completing the Grace Hopper program, I now understand what I'm passionate about and what drives me. I am a pragmatic software 
                engineer and an idealistic marketer looking to work on a team building intuitive tools.
              </br>
                I seek a software engineering position within a company that works on cutting-edge technologies, that invests in its employees, and where I can continuously grow and learn.

            </p>
    
            <p>Here's a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>

                </h3>
                <h4>Honours BSocSc in International Studies and Modern Languages</h4>
                <p>
                  This multi-disciplinary program introduces students to the study of international issues, 
                  trans-border phenomena and intercultural relations of all kinds. It leads to an in-depth 
                  understanding of the complex connections and interactions among local, national, regional 
                  and global processes. It exposes students to a wide range of disciplinary viewpoints — 
                  including economics, geography, history and world religions — while simultaneously providing 
                  a solid and rigorous foundation in political science. As a complement to its focus on 
                  international studies, the program offers advanced foreign-language training. Students acquire 
                  proficiency in Canada's two official languages and in at least one additional modern language, 
                  thus preparing them for the demands of an internationally-oriented career. The program also 
                  develops fundamental skills in critical-thinking, analysis and synthesis, and teaches students 
                  a variety of research methods. Students benefit from extensive international opportunities, 
                  including study abroad, international field-research courses, a Model UN course, and 
                  international internships. In addition to their second official language, students can choose 
                  to study one of the following modern languages: Arabic, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, 
                  Portuguese, Russian or Spanish. This program is offered in English and in French.

                <h4>Minor in Economics</h4>
                <p>
                  Economics examines how individuals and society make choices in a world where resources are 
                  limited. It focuses on the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. 
                  Two important themes are efficiency (the absence of waste in the use of resources) and fairness. 
                  Since making choices is central to all human activities, studying economics often helps 
                  explain why people and governments behave in certain ways.

                    Working closely with Account Executives, my primary mandate is to identify 
                    and prospect targeted companies as new opportunities of sale. From the strategic 
                    analysis of their B2B marketing landscape, MarTech needs and demand generation pain points, 
                    I utilize cold calling, account-based selling, and strategic planning to initiate the sales 
                    cycle.
